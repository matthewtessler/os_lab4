/* if jobMix is two there are four processes -> each process makes references
		   within itself sequentially, making three references each in a round robin style between
		   the four processes -> the initial reference is determined by a formula dependent on the 
		   number of that process and the size of all individual processes (processSize - S) */

/* if jobMix is three it is like jobMix two except references are not sequential, they are 
		   determined by randomOS -> the initial reference is determined by same formula as jobMix two */


/* if jobMix is four it is still three references per process in round robin except the number
		   it is referencing is randomly selected */
